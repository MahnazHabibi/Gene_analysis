# Gene_analysis
Unsupervised learning methods to Identify essential genes associated with SARS-CoV-2


Descripotion:

This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the "Comprehensive analysis of genes in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) using unsupervised three machine learning methods":

Data sets:

File "Process related to 332 proteins.xlsx" contains 1,374 informative biological processes related to COVID-19 that are published on the Gene Ontology.

File "List_Protein_Name.mat" is the MATLAB .mat file contains the list of 20,040 proteins which are analized.

File "Feature_Matrix.mat" is the MATLAB that contains informative features for 20,040 proteins from inputs related to COVID-19

To run an algorithm "Topological_feature.m".

To run three machine learning algorithms follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
